JavaScript Quiz Game Project
Scenario:
You are tasked with creating an interactive quiz game where users can answer questions, and the webpage will respond dynamically. The project aims to assess your proficiency in various JavaScript concepts and commands.

----Project Requirements----

HTML Structure:
_Create an HTML file with a quiz container.
_Include a question display area and an input field for users to enter their answers.
_Add an HTML element that will be dynamically updated to provide feedback to the user.


JavaScript Functionality:
_Use document.getElementById() to select necessary HTML elements.
_Implement basic input/output functionality:
_Get user input using prompt and display it on the webpage.
_Use console.log() to log the input to the browser console.

_Implement a timed quiz question:
Use setTimeout() to delay the appearance of the first question.
Use setInterval() to update the countdown timer.

_Implement a self-calling function:
Declare a variable using var and use it within a function that calls itself.
Utilize the Math object:
Generate a random number and use it in a mathematical operation.

_Use the Map object:
Store quiz questions and answers in a Map object.
_Implement a debounce function:
Use setTimeout to delay the execution of a function until after a specified time.
_Create a poll mechanism:
Use setInterval to repeatedly check a condition.

_Use the Once function:
Ensure a specific function is executed only once.
_Implement the getAbsoluteUrl function:
Convert a relative URL to an absolute URL.

_Manipulate strings and arrays:
Convert a string to lowercase.
_Use Array.push, Array.filter, and Array.reduce.
Extract a substring using String.substr.
_Use String.slice(start, end).
_Check if a function is native:
Implement the isNative function.
_Debugging:
Insert a debug statement in your code for debugging purposes.

_Use a for loop:
Iterate over an array of quiz questions.

_Implement an if-else statement:
Check if the user's answer is correct.

_Create an object using a constructor function:
_Define a Question object using a constructor.
_Work with the Math object:
Perform a mathematical operation.
_Work with the Date object and Error object:
Create a Date object and a custom error using the Error object.
_Use various methods for number formatting:
toExponential, toFixed, toPrecision, valueOf, parseInt.
_Normalize a string:
Use the normalize() function.

_Use slice(start, end):
Extract a portion of a string.

_Implement epsilon in numerical comparison:
Use a small value to compare numbers.
_Use toJSON() and toISOString():
Format a date object.
_Explore the Proxy() object:
Intercept operations on an object.
_Implement a simple promise.
_Explore mixins:
Combine properties of multiple objects.

_Use autocorrection:
Fix a typo in a string using unescape().

_Generate an array of numbers:
Programmatically create an array of integers.
_Verify a condition:
Check if the user's answer matches the correct answer.

_Create a cookie:
Store the user's score in a cookie.

_Use the shift() method:
Remove the first question from the array.

-----Bonus Query:-----
Perform an operation involving NEGATIVE_INFINITY.
Project Submission
Submit the HTML and JavaScript files.
Include comments for each section of code to explain the purpose and functionality.
Provide a brief documentation file explaining how the different JavaScript commands and concepts are utilised in your project.
Note: Feel free to enhance the project with additional features or styling to showcase your creativity and understanding of JavaScript. Good luck!
